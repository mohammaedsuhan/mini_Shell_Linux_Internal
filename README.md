# mini_Shell_Linux_Internal

Mini shell is a command processor, typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions. Every Operating System provides this Command Line Interface (CLI) which takes commands from the user and provides required output. BASH can also read commands from a file, called a script. Like all Unix shells, it supports piping and variables as well. 

 

The goal of this project is to implement a mini-shell that mimics the BASH shell by using Linux Kernel System calls and IPC mechanisms like signals. It will also handle special keyboard actions (ex: Control C), can be extended for advanced functionalities (ex: Command history) as well.
